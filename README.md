# software_design_db_admin

# This a school related project based on the course Software design and implementation and advanced database administration

## The project is for 2 courses.

### We will build an application that will take pictures of a potato and determine whether it is affected by a disease or not. if so a Diagnose will be peoduced. 

#### For the app we will use React JS and tensorflow flow . React JS will help us build the interface and tensorflow will help us build our deep learning model which will be used for prediction
#### Google cloud or aws will be used as additional tool for either hoisting or additional cloud computing functions

### For the second course, we will build a distributed database system where we will store data collected from different farmers and data from different datasets

#### Our database will be built in postgresql

## Thats why we have 3 different branches
### AI_model for the tensorflow prediction model
### web_app for the react JS UI
### db_admin for the database

#### So when working on a particular part of a project, make sure to always be on that branch
